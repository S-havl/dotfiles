# Dotfiles
# Inspired by BlackArch
My personal Linux configuration files (shell, editor, git, etc.).  
This repository allows me to quickly set up a familiar environment on any machine.

---

##  Features
- Shell configuration (`zsh`, `bash`)
- Editor setup (`vim`/`vi`)
- Terminal settings
- Other configs under `~/.config/`

## Notes

This repo contains no private data (no API keys, passwords, SSH keys, etc.).

Some configs may depend on software you need to install separately (e.g. zsh, neovim, tmux).

Feel free to fork and adapt for your own environment.
